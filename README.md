# Online Food Ordering

This project was done as a part of undergraduate term project.

It was built using Django - 1.8 along with bootstrap and jquery in front end and oracle 11g with PL/SQL as database.

A simple UI is provided for users to log in / sign up and browse foods of different restaurants according to their category, price etc. 

They can add specific amount of food to their cart and order the whole cart. 

To resolve these food orders, an admin site was also developed by extending Django built in admin panel.
